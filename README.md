# Sickle of curtain light

I found that there was no zoomeye GUI in the market, so I wrote one myself. The interface is a little ugly,hahaha.

## Use

>Download release, write your zoomeye api-key in userinfo.json, double-click to open the EXE file, fill in the query criteria, fill in the number of pages, select the query type and click query

## Basic functions:

1. Multiple pages can be queried

2. Excel can be exported



## TODO

1. Add multithreading and use multithreading for parallel processing of multiple pages

2. ~~It needs to be modified when exporting excel~~

3. English version

4. Other issues
